In the world of subcompact-crossover SUVs, the 2020 Ford EcoSport is a bit of a unicorn. It is powered by a 1.0-liter 3-cylinder EcoBoost engine that is neither terribly powerful nor fuel efficient, and it doesn't offer many of the driver-assist systems now standard on most of its competitors. Buyers can opt for a more powerful 2.0-liter engine, but only on models with all-wheel drive. The EcoSport looks sharp, with traditional Ford family SUV DNA and a side-hinged rear door that makes loading from a city sidewalk a lot easier. Still, up against the Honda HR-V, Hyundai Kona and Mazda CX-3, the EcoSport may have a tough time convincing buyers why they should pay the same money for less content. Driving the 2020 Ford EcoSport The 2020 Ford EcoSport is one of the few subcompact SUVs to offer a choice of engines. Based on power-to-weight ratios, it's understandable why EcoSport models with the smaller, 3-cylinder EcoBoost are among the slower entries in the segment. There is noticeable turbo lag upon acceleration from a stop, and power doesn't really come on strong until the revs pass 2,000 rpm. Models fitted with the 166-horsepower 4-cylinder engine have a bit more power on hand, but fuel economy suffers greatly. Fuel economy for the smaller engine is about average at 28 mpg combined, while the larger engine's 25 mpg combined places it in the bottom half of the segment. Where the EcoSport shines brightest is on twisting roads. The suspension and steering deliver a performance on par with the Mazda CX-3, making this one of the best-handling subcompacts on the market.
