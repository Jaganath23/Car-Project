<h3> Selling a Car: Trade It In or Sell It Yourself? </h3>

<p>Selling your car yourself is only one option when it’s time to replace it. You can also trade it in. There are check marks in the “pro” and “con” columns for each option. In other words, don’t make a snap decision. Here are what we see as the positives and negatives of trading in and selling yourself.
<br><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Trading It In</li>
<p>There are many benefits to trading in your old car, including, most notably, how easy it is. It’s simple: You take your old car to the dealer, the dealer makes you an offer, and you put that money toward buying your new car. You don’t handle any paperwork, as the dealer takes care of all that. Just drive in with your old car and drive out with your new one.
<br><br>
But there’s a major disadvantage to trading in your old car: money. Since the dealer still needs to make money on the car, they won’t give you retail value for it — and they certainly won’t give you as much as you could make by selling it yourself. So while you avoid the hassle of selling your car by trading it in, you may lose hundreds or thousands of dollars.
<br><br>
But while trading in your old car won’t get you top dollar, money may not be as big of a factor as you think. In most states, sales tax is only calculated based on the difference between the trade-in value of the old car and the purchase price of the new one. That means if you get $10,000 for your trade-in and you’re spending $15,000 on a new car, you only pay taxes on the $5,000 difference — not the full $15,000. While that may not offset the full difference between trade-in value and retail value, it can certainly help.
<br><br></p>
<li>Selling It Yourself</li>
<p>While we recognize that selling your own car can be a difficult process, we think the hassle is usually worth it — especially since the difference between a trade-in offer and a private selling price is often several thousand dollars. Our advice is to try selling the car yourself before trading it in. If that doesn’t work after a few weeks, consider lowering your price, or start thinking about trading it to a dealership.
