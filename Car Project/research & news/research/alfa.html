<h3> Alfa Romeo to Join EV Fray, in its Own Way </h3>
<img src="https://www.autotrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-alfa-romeo-stelvio-driving-front-3qtr.jpg?w=1024&h=1&crop=1" width="500px" height="300px">
<p>Storied Italian brand Alfa Romeo boasts a lengthy history of building some of the most engaging gasoline engines ever put into automobiles. But that may end soon.
<br><br>
Alfa Romeo is entering the world of macchina elettrica, or electric cars. New Alfa Romeo boss Jean-Philippe Imparato says the brand will switch to electrified cars underpinned by architecture designed by parent company Stellantis. Alfa Romeo will no longer develop new cars on its Giorgio architecture. That platform currently underpins the Giulia sedan and Stelvio SUV and will see use in the upcoming Tonale small SUV.
<br><br>
Alfa Romeo has largely charted its own course over the last two decades even as its parent company evolved from Fiat to Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and now Stellantis. The new firm was formed in early 2021. It consists of a slew of brands sold in the U.S. including Jeep, Ram, Fiat, and Alfa Romeo, plus the Citroen, Peugeot, Opel, and other brands not sold in the U.S.
<br><br>
In shelving Giorgio, Alfa Romeo will instead use scalable architecture shared with other Stellantis models. Alfa Romeo’s parent company says it plans for all future vehicles to ride on one of four shared platforms.
<br><br>
What this means for Alfa Romeo’s distinct automotive DNA is unclear, though Imparto offered a show of confidence.
<br><br>
“We must take advantage of the volumes to take all possible opportunities and bring an EV range to Alfa Romeo, but always with the touch of Alfa Romeo,” he said.
