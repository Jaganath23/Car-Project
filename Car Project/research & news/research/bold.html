<h3> Bold Commitment: Cadillac Says All of Its Future Cars Will Be Electric </h3>
<img src="https://www.autotrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2022-Cadillac-CT4-V-Blackwing-005.jpg?w=1024&h=1&crop=1" width="500px" height="300px">
<p>Forget about silky smooth V8 engines. Cadillac is going all-electric sooner vs. later.
<br><br>
Following up on its promise to turn the luxury brand into a genuine Tesla rival, Cadillac chief Rory Harvey said the automaker will not introduce any more gasoline-fueled vehicles. It plans to phase out its last gas-powered models by about 2030. That’s five years prior to the target set by parent company General Motors.
<br><br>
The first fully electric Cadillac is the Lyriq, a $60,000 5-seat SUV that goes on sale early in 2022. Next up is the Celestiq sedan. Then, a 3-row crossover the division says is “inspired” by the iconic Escalade SUV will follow.
<br><br>
Just what electrification means for the big Escalade is perhaps the most important question. The megabuck Escalade is both Cadillac’s biggest seller — nearly 10,000 were delivered during the first quarter of 2021 — and likely the model that delivers GM its largest profit margins. Cadillac revealed during its latest presentation to the media that the average Escalade sells for $102,000.
<br><br>
It’s possible that the next Escalade will draw from the new Hummer, which returns as an electric pickup and SUV lineup under the GMC banner. With up to 1,000 horsepower from its electric motor, the Hummer EV certainly has the power of a flagship SUV.
