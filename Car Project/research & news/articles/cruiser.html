<h3> Autotrader Find: 2004 Toyota Land Cruiser with 25,000 Miles </h3>
<img src="https://www.autotrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2004-toyota-land-cruiser.jpg?w=1024&h=1&crop=1" width="500px" height="300px">
<p>Today’s Autotrader find is a tried-and-true 2004 Toyota Land Cruiser. But what’s unique about it is that with just 24,854 miles on the odometer, it’s likely one of the lowest mileage 100 Series Land Cruiser left in existence.
<br><br>
The 100 Series Toyota Land Cruiser, as it’s known, was sold from the 1998 through 2007 model years.  While it was offered in a number of different variations overseas, here in the US, the 100 changed relatively little over its ten model years on sale.  It used the same 4.7-liter V8 engine throughout its run, but output was increased from 230 horsepower to 235 in 2003 and then to 275 in 2005.  A four-speed automatic transmission was offered from 1998 through 2002, before being swapped out for a new five-speed unit for 2003.  Full-time four-wheel drive came standard.  A locking rear differential was offered for the 1998 and 1999 model years, before being replaced by Toyota’s new ‘Active Traction Control,’ or ‘A-TRAC’ system in 2000.  Every 100 Series Toyota Land Cruiser came with easily-removable third-row jump seats that stowed against the sides of the cargo area, rather than folding flat into the floor, as this was a way to preserve clearance underneath, adding to the vehicle’s off-road capability.
<br><br>
Needless to say, the Toyota Land Cruiser is a legendary vehicle, and the 100 Series generation has become highly sought after as a used adventure vehicle, given its mix of modern features and usually affordable prices.  This one may be better suited for a museum than the trail, though, as its sub-25,000 mile odometer means it’s basically showroom new.  While a figure that low is rare on any 17-year-old vehicle, it’s especially rare on a Land Cruiser, given that these vehicles are known to make it to half a million miles or more with the proper maintenance.  This 100 Series Toyota Land Cruiser time capsule is offered by a private seller in Kailua-Kona on the big island of Kona in Hawaii.  Figure $1,000 or so for shipping to the mainland.  Given its proximity to the ocean, it’s likely that this truck has come into contact with seawater at some point in its life, so we’d want to closely inspect the undercarriage for rust before forking over anywhere near the $42,500 asking price.  If it all checks out, though, this is surely one of the least-used old Toyota Land Cruisers left anywhere in the United States.
